                  This was my final project for my first CS class at Brown and my longest yet; 23 classes and 1,865 lines of code. Our assignment was to build a graphics editor solely based on Java and JavaFX. Below are some features from the project. Not shown (but also functional) is functionality to save/load creations for future work.
