                  In this project we modeled the graph data structure with an adjacency matrix (a 2D array), added most basic functionality, and built a modified version of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Google's PageRank algorithm</a>. The program functions for both directed and undirected graphs. Below are demonstrations of some of the features I implemented:
