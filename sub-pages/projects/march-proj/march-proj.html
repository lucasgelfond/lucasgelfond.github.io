                    During first semester I took Professor Dietrich Neumann's wonderful "Modern Architecture" which has (righly) gained near-cult status on campus. For our final assignment we were tasked either with writing a final paper or creating a model (digital or physical) of a work of architecture that would classify as "Modern" (roughly 1900-1950).
                      <br><br>
                      The architecture department was running an exhibition on Raymond Hood (a Brown alum!) and requested that students model some of his buildings. I chose Hood's "Plan for a Providence City Center," an unbuilt concept for city hall in Providence. Hood was born in Pawtucket, RI; for my first semester at Brown, this felt like a project that really embraced  "Brown," which is why I picked it.
                      <br><br>
                      I worked with the department to make some modifications to the project and the model was set to be displayed in the department's exhibition entitled "<a class = "p-links" href = "https://www.brown.edu/academics/art-history/american-skyscraper-lecture-series">Raymond Hood and the American Skyscraper</a>." Due to complications with COVID-19 I couldn't be on campus to re-print and exhibit the model.
                        <br><br>
                      There were a significant number of inconsistencies between Hood's drawings so I had to make a few creative leaps. I try to keep my descriptions on here fairly minimal, but I wrote up a document justifying most of those leaps that you can find <a class = "p-links" href = "https://github.com/lucasgelfond/Providence-City-Center-Model/blob/master/Final%20Project/Writeup_Justification%20of%20Creative%20Leaps.pdf">on GitHub</a>.
                      <br><br>
                      I built the whole model from scratch using my favorite 3D modeling program, <a class = "p-links" href = "https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>. It allows for parametric design mostly with code and is extremely powerful, in addition to being an open source project. Below are a few images of my model.
                      <br><br>
                      A model with some of the more recent refinements and changes is in progress! Below are some images of the model compared with some of Hood's drawings, some iterations of the model, and the model after being printed on the <a class = "p-links" href = "http://www.browndesignworkshop.org/">Brown Design Workshop's</a> Prusa i3.
